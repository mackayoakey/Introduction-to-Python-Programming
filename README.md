You can also see my completed certificate of the course at the following link:

**The Professional Certificate consists of the following four courses:**

- Computing in Python I: Fundamentals and Procedural Programming
- Computing in Python II: Control Structures
- Computing in Python III: Data Structures
- Computing in Python IV: Objects & Algorithms

My goal was to take notes for each class, but I only really started doing that in the second course. This repo will be a place for me to store those notes for future reference.
