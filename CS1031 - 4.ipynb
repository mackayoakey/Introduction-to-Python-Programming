    "Constructors are like having a form that has some default values filled in. Maybe you gave your name to the receptionists, and they went ahead and printed a copy of your form with that name already entered.

Constructors are the equivalent of putting some data in when the copy of the form is first printed.\n",

For example, when a receptionist at a doctor's office gives you a paper form to fill in, they might go ahead and log separately that a new patient came in. Similarly, a constructor could perform some other operations when an instance is created, like creating a new empty list if it knows things will be added to the list later.\n",
